Interactive LED Control Using Arduino and Push Buttons
This project demonstrates how to control multiple LEDs with individual push buttons using an Arduino Uno. Each button toggles its corresponding LED on or off, with proper state handling and debouncing logic using INPUT_PULLUP mode. Ideal for beginners and hobbyists looking to understand digital I/O, toggling logic, and edge detection in Arduino projects.
